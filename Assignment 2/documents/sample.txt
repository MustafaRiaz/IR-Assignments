Computer technology is an expanding branch of engineering, with roots in both electrical engineering and 
computer science. It includes the related areas of computer hardware and software; computer interfacing, 
programming, and networking; analog and digital electronics; and robotics. Computer technicians, technologists, 
and engineers work in every sector of society, in careers ranging from building and repairing computer systems 
to designing and installing computer networks, to designing and building prototype robots and electronic devices.
 Students taking computer technology courses will learn to work safely with computer equipment, electronic 
circuits, and robotic devices, and will explore the Essential Skills and work habits that are important for 
success in computer technology. Computer technology courses prepare students for apprenticeship, further 
study at college or university, or entry into the workplace directly after graduation.

This course examines computer systems and control of external devices.
 Students will assemble computers and small networks by installing and configuring 
appropriate hardware and software. Students will develop knowledge and skills in electronics, 
robotics, programming, and networks, and will build systems that use computer programs and interfaces
 to control and/or respond to external devices. Students will develop an awareness of related environmental
 and societal issues, and will learn about college and university programs leading to careers in computer
 technology. python, is a good language, you can use python in AI.
